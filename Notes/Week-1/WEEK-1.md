# Week 1

This week I focus on getting my core database knowledge up. I'll figure out how databases actually work under the hood and have a general idea.

Not going to dive into any code this soon. Only lots and lots of theory.

# Day 1:
Good start, the plan is to read the book, "Database System Concepts" from chapter 10 through 18 as I'm told that it is the crust of database inner workings knowledge. I made good progress on Chapter 10 today. It's quite a long chapter but quite interesting.

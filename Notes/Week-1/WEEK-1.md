# Week 1

This week I focus on getting my core database knowledge up. I'll figure out how databases actually work under the hood and have a general idea.

Not going to dive into any code this soon. Only lots and lots of theory.

# Day 1:
Good start, the plan is to read the book, "Database System Concepts" from chapter 10 through 18 as I'm told that it is the crust of database inner workings knowledge. I made good progress on Chapter 10 today. It's quite a long chapter but quite interesting.
# Day 2:
Decent day. We're now 16 pages deep into Chapter 10 but what a chapter it is! And its quite long as well. I am learning a lot though. So far we're more into Operating Systems territory than Database Systems territory. How data is stored physically.
# Day 3
No progress today but I'll cover up in Day 4.
# Day 4
Not done yet but still making progress through the chapter learning about RAID levels.
# Day 5
Ok so we are done with all types of physical storage. Now we are heading to file organisation. So its time to move to logical divisions rather than physical.
# Day 6
Progress, albeit slow
# Day 7
Now we are studying fixed vs variable length records and their mappings to a file
